This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About Me 
My name is Gina Lewis and I a first-year student in the Public Policy and Management program at Heinz! My preferred pronouns are she, her, hers and I am from the Bay Area. Go Raiders, A's, and Warriors! I went to undergrad at Bard College where I majored in Political Studies. Before coming to CMU, I lived in Anton, Panama for two years serving as a Teaching English, Leadership, and Life Skills Peace Corps Volunteer. 

During my time in Panama, I taught English in a high school, gave professional development seminars at a local university, and worked with the Ministry of Education to execute regional events and educational programs. While I wasn't working, I spent time playing sports and attempting to kill snakes and insects. I thoroughly enjoy individual and community development and hope to work for or with local government to generate opportunities and bring down barriers for those in need. 

# What I Hope to Learn 
By taking this course I hope to learn the different aspects of data visualization and be more creative in designing presentations using data. I would like to become more intentional about how I use data to relay information. From these skills, I would like my work to become clearer and more visually appealing. Additionally, I would like to learn about and how to use the different data visualization platforms being used today!
