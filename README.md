This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

#About Me: My name is Gina Lewis and I am in the Public Policy and Management program at Heinz! My preferred pronouns are she, her, hers and I am from the Bay Area.

#What I hope to learn: By taking this course I hope to learn the different aspects of data visualization and be more creative in designing presentations using data. I would like to become more intentional about how I use data to relay information. From these skills, I would like my work to become clearer and more visually appealing. Additionally, I would like to learn about and how to use the different data visualization platforms being used today!
