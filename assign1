My redesign shows the number of participants in the national school lunch program by representing the density of participants on the map of the US. I chose this data visualization because the viewer can easily and instantly compare states. I find this visualization much better to compare states as viewers are already familiar where states are located on the map. Using color saturation is an indicator of where higher or lower numbers of participants in the program are on the map. Additionally, by using the map you can make more sense of why states would have higher amounts than others by being able to see their size in relation to one another. My visualization can compare them in this way and is also engaging because the viewer can gain further information by interacting with the map. From the critique, I realized it was valuable to have the actual number of participants available and this visualization allows the viewer to see the actual number by putting the curser over it. Readers primarily interested in their own state can quickly identify it and get the information they are looking for opposed to the original graph where the numbers were on top of each other and states were hard to identify.
