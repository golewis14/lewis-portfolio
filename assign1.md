# 1: Original Data Visualization

I chose this data visualization becuase I wanted to do something to do with education and found this information interesting. Unfortuntatly, this data visualization and the others within this Pointpoint were not very effective in telling a story or visualizing the data on school lunch participation. I chose this chart specifically becuase I noticed simple changes that could be revised and I felt like I could creatively use the information and present it in a completely different way.  
 
# 2: My Process

First, I discovered the data set and visual that would fit the assignment and allow me to use many of the different techniques and lessons from class. I found the visualization and the data but the excel spreadsheet containing the data required me to clean up and reorganize the columns so it could later be used in Tableau or RawGraphs. Then I did begin to critique the original and think about what parts of the original should remain and what should be changed. This revolved around evaluating the areas within the critique method we used this week. What stuck out to me during this part of the process was revising the "easier" alternations such as the title but also thinking about engagement and how I could potentially recreate the visualization in a more engaging way that was clear and served the audience it is primary for. 

When moving to creating the wireframe stage, I improved upon the original by changing it to a bar chart and limiting the words used in the title and the x-axis. As we did in a workbook exercise, I decided to not write out the entire state name but instead put the abbreviation right above the bar it belonged to. I found this to be a major improvement from the line graph because line graphs are better used when showing data over time and it was hard to see what point when to which state.

When asking for feedback I received the following responses:

1. Can you tell me what you think this is?
The number of school lunch program participants by state. (both said something similar)

2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Telling how many students there are in the school lunch program by state.
Telling which states have the most and least participants in the school lunch program. It is comparing the states to each other.

3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
The scale is surprising. You write participants are in 1,000s meaning the actual participants are in millions which seems incorrect. 
It is confusing how the first measure on the y-axis is 500k and then moves up to 100k, I think you meant 50k. Data doesn’t make sense that way. 

4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Policy analysts interested in children’s poverty levels per state.
People looking to compare school lunch programs per state.


5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I would change the y-axis to accurately represent the participant level.
If people were interested in knowing the actual number of participants in each state, I would want to have that information visible somewhere.


My Takeaways from feedback:
I learned the numbers were completely misleading on the original and then in my sketch. I was shocked I missed that and now find my source questionable when I once found it extremely reliable. I also learned that the bar chart with the state abbreviations was easier for viewers to locate the state but by omitting the actual numbers associated with each it could be a problem if that was what the audience was interested in. 

After this step in the process, I began thinking about how I could incorporate their feedback and also present the data in a more engaging way. I felt as though it could be more than a line or a bar chart but was unsure which direction to go. I then went to RawGraphs to begin to build my solution without having a completely clear picture but knew which elements needed to be included and I wanted a visualization that could do it all. I was not successful in RawGraphs so I moved to Tableau and ended up very pleased with the final product.

My redesign shows the number of participants in the national school lunch program by representing the density of participants on the map of the US. I chose this data visualization because the viewer can easily and instantly compare states. I find this visualization much better to compare states as viewers are already familiar where states are located on the map. Using color saturation is an indicator of where higher or lower numbers of participants in the program are on the map. Additionally, by using the map you can make more sense of why states would have higher amounts than others by being able to see their size in relation to one another. My visualization can compare them in this way and is also engaging because the viewer can gain further information by interacting with the map. From the critique, I realized it was valuable to have the actual number of participants available and this visualization allows the viewer to see the actual number by putting the curser over it. Readers primarily interested in their own state can quickly identify it and get the information they are looking for opposed to the original graph where the numbers were on top of each other and states were hard to identify.
