# Final Project Outline

My interest:

After hearing information and data on the impacts of eating meat, specifically beef, I adjusted better serve our planet for the future. I would like to give some of this information to others. We are or will all face devastation and change in regards to climate change but dietary alternations go a long way in conserving resources and reducing emissions. 

What is the aim/target of the story? 

To highlight and explain the impact of our food production and consumption. Paint a picture that will elicit people to reevaluate their choices and consider alternatives to reduce emissions and effects of climate change. At minimum, I would like the story to give people a picture of where we are in regard to the cost of food production and consumption and what that means for the environment and vulnerable populations now and in the future. 

How do you plan to measure the success story?
- Visualizations of the resources (water, energy, land) that are put into meat production
- Explain and visualize environmental impact and consequences
- SHOW success by identifying progress that has been made on an individual level by people 
- Trends of veganism and development of non-meat products

How many sections/chapters do you this you will need?

I think I will need around eight section or chapters. Outlined as follows:
1.	Effects of Climate Change in Future
2.	Lead Contributing Activities (highlighting meat/poultry production)
3.	Brief history of how we have come to eat and produce like we do in US
4.	US’s Contribution and Impact
5.	Rise in Veganism and Vegetarianism 
6.	Larger number of non-meat options existing today making diet change “easier”
7.	Facts and figures of limiting meat consumption on personal level
8.	Call to action: The audience can adopt new diet entirely, participate in “meatless Mondays”, try to consume less at their own pace and choice

Do you have enough time and resources? Anticipated challenges?

I believe so. A lot of information exists regarding the subject. Many reports and papers have been done, it was a little difficult getting access to some raw data but I found some I think will be useful to tell my story. I think it is challenging to narrow things to do with climate change to one area but I hope to keep it centered around the food aspect so the audience comes away with a single concrete thing to do for change.
