# User Research Protocol and Interviews


A. Target Audience: 
My story is targeting a broad audience. Mainly anyone in the US unaware of how largely food plays into climate change and the environment. I am aiming to reach those who may even know some but have or have not considered what the slightest change in their diet could do to improve the world's condition. In my interviews I hope to get as much of a range as possible of people (demographically and diet wise) to better tell my story to reach a grander audience. The more people I can appeal to with my story the greater impact it will have.

B. Identifying Interviewees:
Having quite a few different people to choose from to interview, I had to decide those who would provide different perspectives and are familiar and unfamiliar with the story. Not only that, I wanted to make sure to have at least one in person interview to be able to see the reaction or faces of confusion that may not translate virtually. I decided to choose a single mid-twenties graduate student male(1), my older meat eating mom(2), and my 14 year old niece(3). I think my interviewees have been exposed to this topic in different ways and I wonder how engaging the story will be to those more or less familiar and how that will impact them. Additionally, two of the three individuals are from different regions of the US and all of them live in different states and have different lifestyles now. 


Goals:
1. Identify areas that present as unclear or could be simplified
2. Identify any missing information or areas that could be supplemented 
3. Gauge persuasiveness of story, ways to be more impactful
4. Check for understanding and see if message being attempting to be conveyed is received 
5. Identify if anything is missing

Method:
- 10 minute interview
- Ask and answer questions while taking notes throughout the process
- Both in person and via phone call (will send storyboard with wireframes to interviewee to discuss ahead of time)

C. SCRIPT

Introduction: I am familiar with everyone I am interviewing so I will give them background on what I am doing as far as the assignment and what my story is about. This is a brief overview because I do not want to say too much beforehand but rather let the storyboard tell itself. I will let them know I have some questions for them to answer honestly and that I will be taking notes to help me use their commentary to revise and edit my project.

Questions Asked:

1. Was the information presented in a way you could easily follow?
2. What, if anything, is confusing?
3. Do you have any questions regarding the information?
4. What stands out to you?
5. Is there anything you more you would like to see?
6. What do you take away from this storyboard? 
7. What if anything would compel you to eat less meat?


Responses to Questions: 

Q1.
Person 1: Umm, yes.
Person 2: Well I could follow it by reading it, I dont know what some of it has to do with the other. 
Person 3: Yes, sure.


Q2.
Person 1: Nothing I can think of it makes sense. I didnt understand the text blocks with nothing in them. Also the major contributors section could be clearer, what that arrow to the pie graph is indicating.
Person 2: First you're talking about climate change and then it goes to food history. US contribution to what? The people's response to what? Less meat? I dont know what that is about. It seems disconnected to me. 
Person 3: I dont know what the frowny face and arrows are doing.

Q3.
Person 1: What the impacts are of being vegan.
Person 2: Umm, no I dont have any questions, am I supposed to?
Person 3: No, I kinda know about food and climate change. I think the sequence and contents make sense. 

Q4.
Person 1: The white space. How much meat production plays into climate change.
Person 2: That it is going to be fun figuring out a title. I like the pie chart. 
Person 3: The colorful graph.

Q5.
Person 1: Easy things I can do, examples of sustitutes or practices people use. I would like to know more about what impact there is on an individual level. Also, you have "use of resources of meat production" I wonder what that is compared to vegetable production. How much more meat actutally consumes of resources. 
Person 2: I cant read it, its too small so larger text. Maybe what can be done to make things better, to slow climate change down. Whose responsibility is it?
Person 3: No, I dont think so.

Q6.
Person 1: That our food choices play a role in climate change.
Person 2: That the consumption of meat is making climate change worsen.
Person 3: Why people should stop eating meat, save the climate of the Earth.


Q7.
Person 1: The health impacts, climate impacts, and maybe animals dying...I dont super care about animals dying. 
Person 2: Just keep hearing how bad it is to the environment and yourself, the other ways to get protein. 
Person 3: To know that our Earth would die if I kept eating it.
