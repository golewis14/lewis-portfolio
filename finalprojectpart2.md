# User Research Protocol and Interviews


A. Target Audience: 
My story is targeting a broad audience. Mainly anyone in the US unaware of how largely food plays into climate change and the environment. I am aiming to reach those who may even know some but have or have not considered what the slightest change in their diet could do to improve the world's condition. In my interviews I hope to get as much of a range as possible of people (demographically and diet wise) to better tell my story to reach a grander audience. The more people I can appeal to with my story the greater impact it will have.

B. Identifying Interviewees:
Having quite a few different people to choose from to interview, I had to decide those who would provide different perspectives and are familiar and unfamiliar with the story. Not only that, I wanted to make sure to have at least one in person interview to be able to see the reaction or faces of confusion that may not translate virtually. I decided to choose a single mid-twenties graduate student male(1), my older meat eating mom(2), and my 14 year old niece(3). These three are vastly different in age and will hopefully provide me with different perspectives. I think my interviewees have been exposed to this topic in different ways and I wonder how engaging the story will be to those more or less familiar and how that will impact them. Additionally, two of the three individuals are from different regions of the US and all of them live in different states and have different lifestyles now. 


Goals:
1. Identify areas that present as unclear or could be simplified
2. Identify any missing information or areas that could be supplemented 
3. Gauge persuasiveness of story, ways to be more impactful
4. Check for understanding and see if message being attempting to be conveyed is received 
5. Identify if anything is missing

Method:
- 10 minute interview
- Ask and answer questions while taking notes throughout the process
- Both in person and via phone call (will send storyboard with wireframes to interviewee to discuss ahead of time)

C. SCRIPT

Introduction: I am familiar with everyone I am interviewing so I will give them background on what I am doing as far as the assignment and what my story is about. This is a brief overview because I do not want to say too much beforehand but rather let the storyboard tell itself. I will let them know I have some questions for them to answer honestly and that I will be taking notes to help me use their commentary to revise and edit my project.

"Hello, thank you for helping me with my assignment. I am doing a project that will tell a story using research collected and made into data visualizations and explaination leading toward a call to action. I would like you to take a minute to look through the storyboard and get an initial idea of my story. I will then ask you a set of questions I have prepared and feel free to answer honestly and ask any questions that you may have. Thanks again!"

Questions Asked:

1. Was the information presented in a way you could easily follow?
2. What, if anything, is confusing?
3. Do you have any questions regarding the information?
4. What stands out to you?
5. Is there anything you more you would like to see?
6. What do you take away from this storyboard? 
7. What if anything would compel you to eat less meat?


Responses to Questions: 

Q1.

Person 1: Umm, yes.

Person 2: Well I could follow it by reading it, I dont know what some of it has to do with the other. 

Person 3: Yes, sure.


Q2.

Person 1: Nothing I can think of it makes sense. I didnt understand the text blocks with nothing in them. Also the major contributors section could be clearer, what that arrow to the pie graph is indicating.

Person 2: First you're talking about climate change and then it goes to food history. US contribution to what? The people's response to what? Less meat? I dont know what that is about. It seems disconnected to me. 

Person 3: I dont know what the frowny face and arrows are doing.

Q3.

Person 1: What the impacts are of being vegan.

Person 2: Umm, no I dont have any questions, am I supposed to?

Person 3: No, I kinda know about food and climate change. I think the sequence and contents make sense. 

Q4.

Person 1: The white space. How much meat production plays into climate change.

Person 2: That it is going to be fun figuring out a title. I like the pie chart. 

Person 3: The colorful graph.

Q5.

Person 1: Easy things I can do, examples of sustitutes or practices people use. I would like to know more about what impact there is on an individual level. Also, you have "use of resources of meat production" I wonder what that is compared to vegetable production. How much more meat actutally consumes of resources. 

Person 2: I cant read it, its too small so larger text. Maybe what can be done to make things better, to slow climate change down. Whose responsibility is it?

Person 3: No, I dont think so.

Q6.

Person 1: That our food choices play a role in climate change.

Person 2: That the consumption of meat is making climate change worsen.

Person 3: Why people should stop eating meat, save the climate of the Earth.


Q7.

Person 1: The health impacts, climate impacts, and maybe animals dying...I dont super care about animals dying. 

Person 2: Just keep hearing how bad it is to the environment and yourself, the other ways to get protein. 

Person 3: To know that our Earth would die if I kept eating it. 


D. Interview Findings:

Feedback I received from the interviews was somewhat helpful in moving forward. Having talked to three completely different individuals it was interesting to see what their take was on the story. The graduate student found things to be clear, my mom was hung up on small details and better titles and flow, and my niece was not that engaged and very teenager-like. Regardless, it made me think of ways to appeal to such a large audience all at once. I am sure some people prefer different styles. Maybe having more interactive features is better for the youth, and being more explicit with what I am doing would have allowed my mom to better follow the story. I will say I thought some of the devices used were intuitive but the arrows indicating increases and decreases in effects of climate change was not well received by two out of three of my interviewees. 

Something I did notice despite how confusing or clear the storyboard is, was that they all came away with a similar message which I was happy to hear. This signals to me that the takeaway from my story is being heard, I think the internal aspects and details can be improved and more informative. My titles need to be more descriptive and connected, everything flows in my head but I must make things clearer and say them outright for the reader.

E. Changes Implemented from Interviews:

The graphs on my initial storyboard are not the ones I plan to keep. Those are originals from some of my sources and I figured they would be better place holders than a Balsamiq icon. I am glad I used them because people often reacted positively to the use of color. From class I know this should be kept limited but I am going to try and incorporate color to draw attention to key areas of visualization and statements I want to make.

I think one of my interviewees feedback regarding an additional section for the use of resources in vegetable production and other areas was a valid point. I will add a comparator next to meat production as a way to view the differences and hopefully emphasize the point that so much more natural resources are used when producing meat. Also I am adding how not only US contributes but breaking out into a small section on developing countries to show more context. When countries further develop meat consumption rises. All of this is problematic for the sake of climate change which is why I think it could be beneficial to add. Other changes include:

- More detailed, captivating titles and subtitles
- Specific examples of actions that can be taken instead of a general call to action (ie. Meatless Mondays, etc.)
- Captivating data visuals that are not bar or pie charts, straying from the typical data viz to more graphic imaging and shapes to portray information (the parts of the original that were unusual prompted the view to ask questions and think more into it, so I would like to incorporate that somehow without being outright unclear)
