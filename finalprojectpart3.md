During the creation of this final project, part three was definitely the most challenging. Bringing everything together to make a final product was hard even though I had done the previous parts in preparation. After part two, specifically getting feedback from interviews, I struggled with what the final project would look like in terms of telling a story I was happy with and that my audience would be engaged in and able to follow. 

I had some takeaways initially from the feedback in part two, but the result of that part of the project did not finish when I turned it in. In order to truly incorporate what I had heard, it took a few days to marinate in my mind. When I went to do the project in Shorthand, it was still there in my mind. Specifically, I was grappling with what my story really was. After hearing the feedback that my interviewees were getting mixed messages with the title referring to climate change and my call to action about food choice, it seemed disconnected. I spent time thinking of ways to help my audience flow through my story while also receiving the information and areas I found were imperative to tell. 

Instead of starting with climate change and all of the negative effects and going into food, food production, resources used, and then my call to action to do with meat restricted and limited diets, it became clear that I needed to start with food choice and frame the overall story to my audience from the beginning. This would allow the story to be easier to follow because they are provided with more information from the start. It should not be a puzzle as to what I was trying to get at and it seemed so initially with the trajectory from parts one and two. While it seemed clear to me, it was not, and hearing that completely modified my entire project for what I think to be the better. 

Since my target audience is broad and literally everyone and anyone who chooses what they eat, the story had to cater to people that know nothing about the subject to those who know quite a bit. I decided to do this by being more text heavy than I would have liked but I wanted anyone who might stumble upon my project to be able to pick it up and get the key takeaway. Additionally, I wanted the area of my audience who may be well-versed in the topic and already conscience about what they eat to at least pick up one or two new insights from it. Having been well acquainted with the topic myself, I found the data visualizations that put the land and resources used by product in terms of protein and kilograms to be an interesting way of thinking about resource use. I was also unaware of the energy conversion aspect and while one can assume the information it still is quite shocking and telling. 

After the interviews from part two, I took the opportunity to get insights from a friend who is well aware of the topic to see what they found interesting or lacking. This brought me to add another graph of not just land and energy in the resources used section but also water. I also kept the pie chart, despite my feelings toward pie charts because it was so well received by viewers. Being familiar with chart style and type in this way seemed like a way to help my story be easily understood by my target audience (those less familiar with the topic).

Another adjustment I made was to the final section leading into the call to action. I originally wanted another chart showing the trend of veganism, but at that time and prior I had to decide what and how many data visualizations were necessary.In the way people do not like to read large amounts of text, I don't think it is ideal to scroll through numerous graphs. For this reason, I made my final section more informative through text, definitions, labeling, and buttons to sites with further information to be explored. This way a reader can take the time to learn about the different diets or not and get right to the resources on what options are available and outlining a plan for change. I also did not want my final section to revolve around just being vegan or vegetarian. By shifting the focus off of only providing these limited options, I think it gives my audience more power and ability to make changes at their own pace. 

When it came down to putting the pieces together, my process was to go section by section and input the visualizations and find images that complimented and transitioned well from section to section. Once a section was complete, I would review it from the very beginning checking for cohesiveness and flow before moving onto a new section. Everything did not happen in one nice swoop, I did have to retrace my steps and supplement earlier sections with information that would later play out. Ultimately, this process was very challenging and I feel like I could critique and work on this story forever. I found that feedback from others was one of the most important elements of the process and I cannot help but think of the ways more viewers and feedback would allow my story to be even better.
